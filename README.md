Digital Clock & Stopwatch Pro

A sleek, responsive web-based digital clock with dual-mode functionality, built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project features a modern Glassmorphism UI and supports both desktop and mobile interactions.

🚀 Features
•	Dual Time Modes: Toggle between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats.
•	Integrated Stopwatch: A fully functional stopwatch with Start, Stop, and Reset capabilities.
•	Mode Switching: Easily switch between the Clock and Stopwatch using buttons or swipe gestures.
•	Touch Gestures: Optimized for mobile with Swipe Left to access the stopwatch and Swipe Right to return to the clock.
•	Glassmorphism UI: High-quality aesthetic featuring background blurs, gradients, and floating decorative shapes.
🛠️ Technologies Used
•	HTML5: Structure and semantic layout.
•	CSS3: Advanced styling including Flexbox, Backdrop-filters (Glassmorphism), and animations.
•	JavaScript (ES6): State management, setInterval timers, and Touch Event listeners.

⚙️ How It Works

1. The Clock Logic
The clock uses the Date() object to pull local system time. It uses a toggle variable is24Hour to determine how to display the hours.
•	24H: Direct output from getHours().
•	12H: Uses the modulo operator ($hrs \pmod{12}$) and a ternary operator to define the AM/PM string.
2. The Stopwatch
The stopwatch tracks a single variable swSeconds. When started, a setInterval increments this value every 1000ms. The display function then mathematically converts the total seconds into an HH:MM:SS format.
3. Gesture Navigation
The app listens for touchstart and touchend events on the main container. It calculates the horizontal distance ($X_{end} - X_{start}$) to determine if the user performed a valid swipe.
